## Auditory Data Scientist

I specialize in sound and brain data. I completed my Ph.D. at Columbia University (Psychology 2019-2025) in [Sarah Woolley's lab](https://woolleylab.com/). My [dissertation research](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/7bt6-xb79) was funded by an [NIH training grant](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/ipd8KKjb7kqwONlKDV9PNw/project-details/10607688) and studied biological constraints on the temporal and sequential organization of birdsong, which is the animal model used to study speech learning, production and perception.

My M.Sc. is from Colorado State University (Biology 2015-2018; [thesis research](https://mountainscholar.org/items/a4c01647-1c0e-4542-865b-70303540fa55)) and my B.Sc. is from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (Ecology & Evolutionary Biology 2008-2013).

Columbia's Zuckerman Institute did a fun take on [my story](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/science-life-jacob-edwards).

## Teaching

I have taught 12 semesters of undergraduate- and graduate-level courses, and have mentored many trainees.

See my reviews for teaching Introductory Statistics at Columbia here:

[2022](/assets/docs/evals_stats_2022.pdf) |
[2024](/assets/docs/evals_stats_2024.pdf)

I helped develop and teach the [*Laboratory in Justice Data Science*](/lab-in-justice-data-science) course for Columbia graduate and undergraduate students. I am very proud of the course and you can learn more about it [here](/lab-in-justice-data-science).
